      function start() {
        // when the var stime is true it means that the stopwatch is not running thats why we have to change its boolean value to false owh i thought true means its running . when you run the web. the default value of stimer is true and the timer at that point is no runnong until the start button is pressed ooh i get it now . yeah the boolean value is just user defined ooh . stimer meant stopotiime thats why i used true okay i have understood that e can we procceed  yesyto the partnext line yes
        if (stime == true) {
          //this line is just the same to what i have just explained in line 31
          stime = false;

        }
      }

          ms = parseInt(ms);

          s = s + 1; // initially s was "0" eachtime tcycle runs it add "1" to s i'll show you the code that makes tcycle  to run like a loop in a short while//nice
          if (s == 60) {
            // this 1st condition is just to change s to min . it checks is s is equal to 60 then adds 1 to ms and resets s to "0"//so this one is for converting to ms yes it works that way //okay
            ms = ms + 1;
            s = 0;
          }
          // iko na shida kama ile ingine ati its not defined i dunno why (^_^)
          if (ms == 60) {
            // same case to this one it almost work as the s conditon but this on now changes ms to hrs //ooh though im wondering why s=0 being declared inside the if statement and like the first one s-s+1 is not inside the if s is the main var that we use in finding ms and hrs whenever s reaches 60 it adds 1 to ms and starts from 0 again but the ms will still hold the value added//oooh okay .is it clear now yes it is so inshort that s+1 is to enble the s to reach 60 so that ms can have its value yes thats correct!//okay next line
            hr = hr + 1;
            ms = 0;
            s = 0;
          }
          if (s < 10 || s == 0) {
            // the display of a stopwatch should be 00:00:00
            s = "0" + s; // now this if statment makes sure the swatch display is correct. it checks if s is less than 10 or equals to 0 thats between 0-9 is so it prints a string "0" and the s value that is "0" + s this means it will display  0"the s value"//ooh so its zero and the s value by the start function yeah the s value in tcycle//oowh yeahhh you okay with is line?yes okay lets go to the next line
          }
          if (ms < 10 || ms == 0) {
            //this is the same but difference is its for ms or? yeah its just same as the s one but it affects the ms display//okay you've understood this one right?yes okay next line we almost done.
            ms = "0" + ms;
          }
          if (hr < 10 || hr == 0) {
            // this is but the same. it only difference is that it affects the hr display . is that okay yeah// onkaey next.
            hr = "0" + hr;
          }
          timer.innerHTML = hr + ":" + ms + ":" + s; //this iss the output now //how it will be displayed yes. this will affect and change the value of const timer.// is this okay absolutely lol okay lets proceed
          setTimeout("tcycle()", 1000); // this acts like a loop now  setTimeout calls now the tcycle its value 1000 is always in millisecond it give it an interval of 1000 milisecond which is equivalent to 1 second .. //so if we input a higher value the timer will run faster.// not really low value means the time will run faster .. it waits for 1000 milisecond to execute .. now if we have 2000 milisecond it will wait for a long period before it execute..
